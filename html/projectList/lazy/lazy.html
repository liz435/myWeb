        Boredom is not necessarily a bad thing, as studies have shown that it can foster creativity and imagination. 
        However, social media and low-quality entertainment on screens have taken away our opportunity to experience boredom. 
        During the COVID-19 pandemic, screen time for adolescents doubled, and this has had an impact on cognitive development.
        Apps on phones provide a quick way to alleviate boredom, but it is a lazy solution that does not encourage creative thinking. 
        The global average screen time connected to the internet is 6 hours and 58 minutes and has been increasing over the years.
        With the advancement of technology and artificial intelligence, it is uncertain where our reliance on screens will take us.
        The younger generation engages with screens far more than previous generations, and in the worst-case scenario, screens may become the only source of stimulation, reducing us to passive spectators.
